# Introduction
What is **data analysis**?

> It is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data
with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and
support decision-making.

Data Analysis tools:
Python, R, Julia.
R is a good option for **advanced statistical methods** or when performance matters.

The Data Analysis **process**:\
Data Extraction $\rarr$ Data Cleaning $\rarr$ Data Wrangling $\rarr$ Analyisis $\rarr$ Action

**Data Extraction**:\
SQL, Scrapping, from files, consulting APIs, buying data.

**Data Cleaning**:\
 Missing values and empty data. Data imputation. Incorrect types. Incorrect or invalid
values. Outliers and not relevant data. Statistical sanitization.

**Data Wrangling** (rearange and reshape):\
Hierarchichal Data. Handling categorical data. Reshaping and transforming structures. Indexing data for quick access.
Merging, combining and joining data.

**Analysis**:\
Exploration. Building statistical models. Visualization and representations. Correlation vs Causation analysis.
Hypothesis testing. Statistical analysis. Reporting.

**Action**:\
Building Machine Learning Models. Feature Engineering. Moving ML into production. Building ETL pipelines.
Live Dashboard and reporting. Decision making and real-life tests.

Data Analysis vs Data Science:\
Data Scientist usually have more maths and programming skills. Data Analysts have better story telling.

## Libraries
pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, scikit-learn.


# Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, etc (RENAME THIS)
Jupyter Notebooks is a mode-based editor. The behaviour depends on the mode: editing mode, command mode. _Escape_ key is used to switch modes.
Navigate with arrow keys. \
In command mode:
* **M** - turns current cell into markdown.
* **Y** - turns current cell into Python code
* **Ctrl + return** - runs the cell
* ***Shift + return** - runs the cell and goes to the next one

`%matplotlib inline`

**requests** library, to connect to an API and extract data.
