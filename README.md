This repository is created with the purpose of completing this course:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python


Also, if you decide to learn from such course I highly recommend you not to copy my code and learn it by yourself.

Here some repositories are put together, instead of creating myself (forking) all these
repositories.
