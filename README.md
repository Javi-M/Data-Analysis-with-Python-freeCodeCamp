This repository is created with the purpose of completing this course:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python


Also, if you decide to learn from such course I highly recommend you not to copy my code and learn it by yourself.

Here some repositories are put together, instead of creating myself (forking) all these
repositories. In commits these are be referenced as [1], [2], etc.
